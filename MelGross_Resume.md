# About Me

My name is Mel and I am a 20 year old artist living in Philadelphia and currently studying Video Game Design and Production at Drexel University. I am passionate about creating things. I love drawing and painting, I also like doing graphic design such as logos and website development, and I am eager to learn more about animation, video game design and programming.

For me the most inspiring thing is to help people. It is great to complete a project for someone and seeing that it helped them in some small or big way. I like making people's day better with my art, or solving someone's problem with my creative skills. 

I was born and raised in Brazil until I was 15 years old, and I went to high school in the Boston area. Throughout my academic life I took classes in many different artistic areas from traditional figure drawing to robotics. Due of my diverse cultural and academic background my creations are very unique and meaningful. 

As I start my career path I will continue to learn as much as I can from as many sources as possible and apply these to my work. I want to continue creating and travelling as much as possible. Right now I am working with video production and project management of a YouTube channel for a painting studio called The Paint Bar and I am in the process of creating handmade planner's stickers to sell online.
